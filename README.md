## **Overview**

The **Inventory API** is a backend system designed to manage inventory operations, track product stock levels, handle inventory movement logs, generate reports, and offer low-stock alerts. Built using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB**, this API ensures smooth inventory management for various businesses and integrates with role-based access control for secure operations.

## **Features**

- üè∑Ô∏è **Product Management**: Add, update, delete, and retrieve inventory items.
- üì¶ **Inventory Movement Logs**: Track and log changes in inventory levels.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Low-Stock Alerts**: Notifications for items that are low in stock.
- üìä **Report Generation**: Generate and export inventory status reports.
- üîê **Authentication & Authorization**: Secure API access with JWT-based authentication.
- üåç **Database Integration**: Support for MongoDB database.

---

## **Getting Started**

### **1. Prerequisites**

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: v14 or higher.
- **npm**: v6 or higher.
- **MongoDB**: A local or cloud MongoDB instance (e.g., MongoDB Atlas).

---

### **2. Installation**

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<YourUsername>/<YourRepository>.git
   cd <YourRepository>
   ```

### **3. Install Dependencies**

Navigate to the project directory and install the required Node.js dependencies:
npm install

### **4. Set Up Environment Variables**

Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and configure it as follows:
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/inventorydb
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
JWT_EXPIRATION=1h
ADMIN_ROLE=admin
EMPLOYEE_ROLE=employee

Explanation of Environment Variables:

    PORT: The port your API will run on (default is 5000).
    MONGO_URI: The MongoDB URI for your database (use MongoDB Atlas if you are using a cloud database).
    JWT_SECRET: A secret key used for signing JWT tokens.
    JWT_EXPIRATION: The expiration time for JWT tokens (e.g., 1h for 1 hour).
    ADMIN_ROLE: Role for admin users who can access all routes.
    EMPLOYEE_ROLE: Role for employee users with limited access.

### **5. Start the Server**

npm start

### **API Endpoints**

Technologies Used

    Node.js: Backend runtime for building scalable applications.
    Express.js: Framework for building APIs and handling HTTP requests.
    MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing inventory data.
    JWT (JSON Web Tokens): Secure user authentication for API access.
    Mongoose: ODM for MongoDB used to interact with the database.

Exporting Reports

The API allows you to generate and export reports:

    Inventory Status: A report showing the current inventory and low-stock items.
    Export Options: You can export reports as PDF or CSV using the following routes:
        GET /api/reports/inventory-status/pdf to export as PDF.
        GET /api/reports/inventory-status/csv to export as CSV.
